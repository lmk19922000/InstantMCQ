Our web application tries to enhance the process of teaching and learning through helping teacher and students interact more with each other. It allows teacher to create multiple choice questions during class and get students' answers immediately in a fast and efficient way. By this way, teacher can have a better overview of the class and adjust the pace of his teaching accordingly.
